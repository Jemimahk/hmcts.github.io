# API Documentation

All teams building APIs should be publishing automatically publishing their documentation using the [OpenAPI Specification 2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md). Teams should use [these instructions](https://github.com/hmcts/reform-api-docs#publish-swagger-docs) for publishing the swagger spec file to the [central api docs repository](https://github.com/hmcts/reform-api-docs).

A network map of micorservice dependencies can be generated using this central repository by manually commiting some additional information about the new service. See the [README](https://github.com/hmcts/reform-api-docs/blob/master/README.md) for information on how to do this.
