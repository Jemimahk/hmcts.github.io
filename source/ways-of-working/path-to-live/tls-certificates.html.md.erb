In non production environments we have a wildcard certificate for `*.<env>.platform.hmcts.net`,
make sure you use a domain that matches that pattern.

For production we require a cert per frontend application, this is procured by the Platform Operations team.

You will need to fill out a form that can be found on the 
[Requesting a SSL / TLS certificate](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=947882506)
confluence page, and then create a ticket on Jira in the DTSPO project.

The vault the certificate should go into is cft-apps-prod.
