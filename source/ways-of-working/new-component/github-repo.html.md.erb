Any developer added to [hmcts org](https://github.com/hmcts) would be able to create a new Github repo.


1. Naming convention for repository name is `{product}-{component}`.
2. Choose from a template in the drop down depending on whether it's a front end or backend component. These templates provide all the boiler plate code needed for a new app. 
    - [spring-boot-template](https://github.com/hmcts/spring-boot-template)
    - [expressjs-template](https://github.com/hmcts/expressjs-template)
3. Repository should be public.
4. Give permissions to GitHub teams created in [Team Onboarding](/onboarding/team/#github-config)
    <table>
     <tr>
       <th>Github Team</th>
       <th>Role</th>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>`<team-name>`</td>
       <td>Write</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>`<team-name>-admins`</td>
       <td>admin</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>[bots](https://github.com/orgs/hmcts/teams/bots) (super humans at HMCTS who have magical powers to do CI)</td>
       <td>admin</td>
     </tr>
    </table>

    `Note: You need to revoke the user level admin access you might have got while creating the repository.`
    
5. Add a branch protection rule for `master` branch with recommended settings
   - Enable `Require pull request reviews before merging`
   - Choose which status checks needs to be mandatory for merging PRs (this can be done only after checks like Jenkins are setup)
   - We recommend enabling `Include administrators`.
