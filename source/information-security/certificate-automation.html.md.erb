<!-- Inspired by the MoJ policy: https://ministryofjustice.github.io/security-guidance/automated-certificate-renewal/#automated-certificate-renewal -->

Where technically suitable, all new HMCTS domains must use automated certificate techniques and services, 
such as [Microsoft managed certificates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-custom-domain-https#option-1-default-use-a-certificate-managed-by-front-door)
(most preferred) or LetsEncrypt (uses ACME)

Over time, existing HMCTS domains must also be considered for migration to automated certificate provisioning and 
management techniques (preferably on their next certificate renewal cycle in advance of expiry) in order to reduce 
the consequences and management overheads of manual certificate renewal.

HMCTS acknowledges that not all systems support automated certificate management,
but leveraging such technology where possible reduces management overheads, the costs of such overheads and the consequences of 
unexpected certificate expiry.

## Manual certificate requests

Where automated certificate renewal is not possible, new certificates must be acquired through the DTS Operations Management team.

To request a manually issued certificate, complete the [certificate request form](https://tools.hmcts.net/confluence/display/RD/Requesting+SSL+Certificates) and send it, 
with a Certificate Signing Request (CSR), to Opsconfman@hmcts.net.
