We have recently implemented a fix to ElasticSearch to give us more reliability and integrity that the cases in ES will match those in the CCD-Data-Store database.



At the time of writing only Probate are the only approved consumers of production ElasticSearch, we understand that this may change in the future as teams will want to utilise the enhanced functionality and performance that ElasticSearch provides. The following process must be adhered to for teams wanting to consume ElasticSearch in production



1. Contact CCD and talk through your requirements with them explaining your circumstances and why you want to use ES in prod
2. Provide detailed information consumption/ usage thresholds and obtain approval from QA/performance team usage is supportable by the system
3. Ensure the latest definition file you want to be used in prod is applied in the ccd-definition-store
4. Once approval has been obtained from CCD that they are happy for you to go live please raise an RDO ticket with DevOps and attach your latest definition file to the ticket. you must include the jurisdiction you wish elasticsearch to pull in
5. After DevOps have confirmed that the work has been done on their end validate the results
