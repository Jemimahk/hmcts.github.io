# API Documentation

All teams building APIs should be automatically publishing their documentation using the 
[OpenAPI Specification 3.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md). The
[OpenAPI Specification 2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) may be used
where version 3.0 cannot be used. For example, automated API gateway configuration may not support version 3.0 in which case
version 2.0 may be used.
Teams should use [these instructions](https://github.com/hmcts/reform-api-docs#publish-swagger-docs) 
for publishing the swagger spec file to the [central api docs repository](https://github.com/hmcts/reform-api-docs).

A network map of microservice dependencies can be generated using this central repository by manually 
commiting some additional information about the new service. 
See the [README](https://github.com/hmcts/reform-api-docs/blob/master/README.md) 
for information on how to do this.
